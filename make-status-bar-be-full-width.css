/*
 * This fixes the issue I've been having in Obsidian 1.x where the status bar
 * is just in the lower right corner of the screen and if you're typing
 * aproaches it it'll go under the status bar and you won't be able to see your
 * typing.
 *
 * This fix makes the status bar go across the whole screen, and your typing
 * won't be hidden by it.
