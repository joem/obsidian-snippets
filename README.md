# obsidian-snippets

This is a collection of various snippets I use, some that I've made and some that I've taken from others. I've noted below when a snippet is from someone else, and all others can be assumed to be by me.

If using any of my own snippets, you don't need to credit me or link to me.

Some useful links to Obsidian docs:

## Folders Different Color Than Files

https://github.com/joem/obsidian-snippets/blob/main/folders-different-color-than-files.css

Make folders a different color than files, so files are easier to spot.
(I need to fix this, since it's far too subtle for me currently.)

## Stronger HRs

https://github.com/joem/obsidian-snippets/blob/main/stronger-hrs.css

Make `<hr>` be a lot stronger and less subtle so they more clearly delineate
sections. This makes them white in dark themes and black in light themes.

## Full Width Status Bar

https://github.com/joem/obsidian-snippets/blob/main/full-width-status-bar.css

This fixes something I don't like about the default theme in Obsidian 1.x where
the status bar is just in the lower right corner of the screen and if your
typing aproaches it the text goes under the status bar and you won't be able to
see your typing.

This fix makes the status bar go across the whole screen, and your typing won't
be hidden by it.

Credits: I *think* that this came from someone on the Obsidian forums, but I'm
not sure (and no idea who) and I think I may have tweaked it? It's also one
simple CSS rule, so I don't think it's a huge deal that I've forgotten its
provenance.
